The following checklist will guide you through the process of setting up the necessary services to host Source++ on your own private servers. We do not charge for or limit the capabilities of Source++ when self-hosting.

At a minimum it is recommended to dedicate at least 4GB of RAM and 20GB of hard drive space to the Source++ stack.
